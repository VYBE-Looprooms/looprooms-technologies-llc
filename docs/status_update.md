# Status Update - 2025-09-16

## Completed Work
- Backend foundation upgraded with Sequelize and PostgreSQL integration, including environment-driven config and bootstrapping.
- Core data models, migrations, and seeders created for Users, Looprooms, Loopchains, Social Feed, Reactions, Sessions, OAuth profiles, and Creator workflows.
- Email and webhook routes extended with authentication services: register/login endpoints using hashed passwords, JWT issuance, and session persistence.
- Database migrations and seeds executed locally to validate schema.
- Frontend received shared API utilities, auth services, context provider, and new Login/Register pages wrapped by routing updates.
- Looproom discovery endpoints (list/detail/categories) and mood recommendation API delivered, serializing categories and loopchain data for the SPA.
- Navbar now exposes auth-aware actions (sign in/out) on desktop and mobile while keeping the waitlist CTA.
- Documentation refreshed (development_plan.md, progress_log.md) to reflect the new architecture work and auth milestone.
- Reaction presets table and seeds shipped with engagement endpoints for reactions and motivations.
- Motivational messages seeded for each MVP looproom and surfaced through the looproom service.
- Authenticated mood dashboard launched, combining presets, recommendations, seeded engagement data, and full-width layout polish.
- Auth refresh endpoint plus protected routes with auto-renew timers keep sessions alive through the dashboard.
- Looproom detail view exposes individual journeys with motivational overlays and CTA routing.
- Socket.io realtime scaffold added (presence, chat, reaction relays) with shared frontend hook for upcoming overlays.
- Looproom chat panel, reaction tray UI, and motivational overlays now live with persisted history and analytics-ready tallies.

## Current Focus
- Keep Vite/React SPA as the delivery layer tied to the Express API.
- Maintain positive-only UX while introducing authenticated flows.
- Prepare the realtime engagement layer to consume newly seeded reactions and motivations.

## Next Tasks
1. Stand up the positive social feed skeleton with moderation hooks and reaction safeguards.
2. Expose creator analytics endpoints and dashboards for chat/reaction insights.
3. Extend motivational overlays into the live session layout with scheduling controls.
4. Advance creator onboarding groundwork (verification flow scaffolding + admin review endpoints).
5. Expand documentation with API references and ERD notes as schema stabilizes.

## Notes
- SMTP errors during local runs stem from placeholder credentials; replace with valid Gmail app passwords in .env when testing email delivery.
- Session revocation endpoint and token refresh flow are deferred until next sprint.
- All new files remain uncommitted; review diffs before version control actions.
