# Status Update - 2025-09-16

## Completed Work
- Backend foundation upgraded with Sequelize and PostgreSQL integration, including environment-driven config and bootstrapping.
- Core data models, migrations, and seeders created for Users, Looprooms, Loopchains, Social Feed, Reactions, Sessions, OAuth profiles, and Creator workflows.
- Email and webhook routes extended with authentication services: register/login endpoints using hashed passwords, JWT issuance, and session persistence.
- Database migrations and seeds executed locally to validate schema.
- Frontend received shared API utilities, auth services, context provider, and new Login/Register pages wrapped by routing updates.
- Navbar now exposes auth-aware actions (sign in/out) on desktop and mobile while keeping the waitlist CTA.
- Documentation refreshed (development_plan.md, progress_log.md) to reflect the new architecture work and auth milestone.

## Current Focus
- Keep Vite/React SPA as the delivery layer tied to the Express API.
- Maintain positive-only UX while introducing authenticated flows.

## Next Tasks
1. Implement looproom/category/loopchain read APIs and expose them to the frontend dashboard.
2. Seed motivational messages and reaction presets for positivity overlays.
3. Build the mood-driven dashboard UI and hook it to the new looproom endpoints.
4. Add protected route guards and token refresh/renewal logic for long-lived sessions.
5. Expand documentation with API references and ERD notes as schema stabilizes.

## Notes
- SMTP errors during local runs stem from placeholder credentials; replace with valid Gmail app passwords in .env when testing email delivery.
- Session revocation endpoint and token refresh flow are deferred until next sprint.
- All new files remain uncommitted; review diffs before version control actions.
