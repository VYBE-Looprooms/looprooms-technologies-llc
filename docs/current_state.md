# VYBE LOOPROOMS™ – Current State

## What Exists Today
- **Landing Page**: Fully designed, live at [feelyourvybe.com](https://feelyourvybe.com).
- **Waitlist System**:
  - Built with **n8n** automation.
  - Collects user emails.
  - Saves data into Google Spreadsheet for future onboarding.

## Current Limitations
- No user accounts or login.
- No Looprooms available yet.
- No creator onboarding/verification.
- No mood → room mapping system implemented.
- Platform is currently in "teaser/waitlist" mode.

**Goal:** Transition from waitlist-only to functional MVP with 5 Looprooms.
