# Camera Issue Fix Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Fixes (MobileVerification.tsx)
- ✅ Fixed API URL detection for HTTPS/HTTP
- ✅ Added SSL certificate error handling
- ✅ Improved camera stream handling with better error detection
- ✅ Added comprehensive video event logging
- ✅ Fixed video playback with proper metadata loading
- ✅ Added document type support (passport vs ID)
- ✅ Improved video element attributes with proper styling

### 2. Backend Fixes
- ✅ Increased rate limiting from 100 to 300 requests per 15 minutes
- ✅ Relaxed CORS policy for development
- ✅ Skipped rate limiting for health checks and validation endpoints
- ✅ Added favicon to prevent 404 errors

### 3. Debug Tools Created
- ✅ Backend connectivity test script (`test-backend.js`)
- ✅ PowerShell development starter script (`start-dev.ps1`)
- ✅ Camera debugger component (`CameraDebugger.tsx`)

## Next Steps to Fix the Camera

### 1. Accept SSL Certificate
The camera requires HTTPS, so you need to accept the self-signed certificate:
1. Visit `https://192.168.3.10:3443/health` in a new tab
2. Click "Advanced" → "Proceed to 192.168.3.10 (unsafe)"
3. Return to your app

### 2. Check Browser Console
Open Developer Tools (F12) and look for:
- Camera permission errors
- SSL/certificate errors
- Video stream errors
- API request failures

### 3. Grant Camera Permissions
- Ensure camera permissions are granted in browser
- Check if camera icon shows "allowed" in address bar
- Try refreshing the page after granting permissions

### 4. Test Camera Directly
You can test the camera debugger component by visiting:
`https://192.168.3.10:8080/camera-test` (if added to routing)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Black Video Screen
- **Cause**: Video stream not properly connected to video element
- **Solution**: Check console for errors, refresh page, ensure HTTPS

### Rate Limiting (429 Errors)
- **Cause**: Too many requests to backend
- **Solution**: Backend rate limit increased, restart if needed

### SSL Certificate Errors
- **Cause**: Self-signed certificate not trusted
- **Solution**: Accept certificate at backend URL first

### Camera Permission Denied
- **Cause**: Browser camera permissions not granted
- **Solution**: Grant permissions in browser settings

## Commands to Restart Everything

```powershell
# Stop all Node processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe

# Start backend
cd backend
node server-https.js

# In another terminal, start frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Test URLs
- Frontend: https://192.168.3.10:8080/
- Backend Health: https://192.168.3.10:3443/health
- Identity Verification: https://192.168.3.10:8080/identity-verification

The camera should now work properly once the SSL certificate is accepted and camera permissions are granted.
